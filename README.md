# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

Horiseon is a company that helps businesses to optimize use of the internet and websites. A business model this technology centered should have an easily accessible and usable interface. The current rendition of Horiseon's website is not very accessible. The code, while functional, was sloppy and provided issues when dealing with things like screen readers and search engines. I cleaned up the code by adding HTML semantics, alt image text, reducing repeating style elements, and inserting comments. I learned about CSS organization and commenting, but what I learned the most about was HTML semantics.
